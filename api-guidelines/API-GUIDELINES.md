# HTTP API Guidelines

The authoritative standard for this project's JSON HTTP APIs — and a portable one: everything
except the [known-gaps register](#appendix-known-gaps-register) is stack-agnostic. It merges a
general API rulebook with the conventions the codebase already implements (bespoke JSON DTOs,
RFC 7807 errors, offset pagination, URL versioning, `PUT` full-document replace — each chosen
deliberately over the JSON:API alternatives; see `README.md` for the decision record). It
covers **document shape**, **resources & URLs**, **versioning & compatibility**, **collections**
(pagination, sorting, filtering), **naming**, **data formats**, **success codes**, **errors**,
**authentication & authorization**, **caching & concurrency**, **rate limiting**,
**idempotency**, **input & transport security**, **HTTP protocol**, **machine-readable
SLA/legal terms**, **OpenAPI as the contract**, and **spec ↔ implementation conformance**.

These rules are written to be **validated**, two ways:

- **Mechanically** — the machine-checkable subset is encoded in
  [`api-guidelines.spectral.yaml`](./api-guidelines.spectral.yaml), a
  [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) ruleset you run against your
  OpenAPI document.
- **By review (LLM or human)** — the semantic and operational rules a linter can't see are
  phrased as unambiguous checks. See the [LLM review checklist](#llm-review-checklist).

## How to read a rule

Each rule has a **stable ID** (cite it, e.g. *"violates API-LIST-002"*), a normative
**MUST / SHOULD** statement, a one-line **Check**, and where useful a **Why**. Tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[spectral]` | Fully checkable by the bundled Spectral ruleset. |
| `[llm/manual]` | Requires review — semantics, runtime behavior, or transport a spec linter can't see. |
| `[both]` | Structure is linted; some part still needs review. |

Keywords **MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / MAY** follow
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

> **Known gaps.** A handful of rules prescribe operational behavior the reference codebase
> does not implement yet (correlation-id echo, `Retry-After`, `ETag`, `Idempotency-Key`,
> HTTP/2, SLA metadata). They are real rules — new work should honor them — but their current
> non-conformance is **accepted and registered**, not drift. See the
> [known-gaps register](#appendix-known-gaps-register); reviewers report those items as
> "registered gap", not as findings.

## API-STRUCT — Document structure

Bespoke, flat JSON documents — deliberately **not** JSON:API (no `data`/`attributes`
nesting, no `application/vnd.api+json`).

### API-STRUCT-001 — Media types `[both]`
**MUST** serve request and success-response bodies as `application/json`, and every error
body (`4xx`/`5xx`) as RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` (see API-ERR-001). **MUST NOT**
introduce other JSON media types or media-type parameters.
**Check (spectral):** every request body and `2xx` response body declares `application/json`;
every `4xx`/`5xx` body declares `application/problem+json`.

### API-STRUCT-002 — Top-level shape `[both]`
**MUST** make every body a single JSON object — never a bare top-level array (arrays are
unwrappable: you can't add fields later without breaking clients). Lists use the envelope of
API-STRUCT-004.
**Check (spectral):** no response schema has top-level `type: array`.

### API-STRUCT-003 — Flat DTOs, references by id `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** model each resource as a flat DTO: domain fields at the top level in `camelCase`
(API-NAME-001), references to other resources as `<name>Id` fields (e.g. `providerId`,
`managerId`), with denormalized display fields (e.g. `managerName`) added only where a UI
needs them and documented as read-only. Related resources are fetched via their own
endpoints; **MUST NOT** embed full related objects inside a resource response. Compound
fetching (`include`-style) MAY be introduced later per-endpoint, but is not part of this
standard today.
**Check:** resource schemas are flat; cross-references are `*Id` scalars.

### API-STRUCT-004 — List envelope `[both]`
**MUST** return every collection as the envelope
```json
{ "items": [ ... ], "page": 1, "pageSize": 20, "total": 137 }
```
— one envelope schema per resource (`UserPage`, `TeamPage`, …) wrapping the resource's
`*Response[]`, kept next to the resource's other schemas. **MUST NOT** return a bare array
or an ad-hoc wrapper. Unpaged endpoints returning an intrinsically tiny set MAY use a plain
`{ "items": [ ... ] }` wrapper, documented as unpaged.
**Check (spectral):** the `200` is not a top-level array. **Check (review):** the envelope
members and per-resource `*Page` schema exist.

---

## API-RES — Resources & URLs

### API-RES-001 — Resource-based paths under the version prefix `[both]`
**MUST** name paths after resources, all under the version prefix (API-VER-001):
a collection is `/api/v1/plural`, a single item is `/api/v1/plural/{id}`.
**Check (spectral):** every path starts `/api/v<major>/`.

### API-RES-002 — Collections are plural, kebab-case `[spectral]`
**MUST** name collections as plural nouns; multi-word names use `kebab-case`
(`/one-on-ones`). **MUST NOT** use `snake_case` or `camelCase` in path segments.
**Check:** each non-parameter path segment matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.

### API-RES-003 — Nouns in paths, verbs are HTTP methods `[both]`
**MUST** express operations through the HTTP method, not the URL. **MUST NOT** put CRUD verbs
in a path (`GET /users`, never `/getUsers`). Actions that don't fit CRUD (state transitions,
commands) **SHOULD** be a `POST` to a verb sub-path of the instance
(`POST /feedbacks/{id}/send`).
**Check:** no path segment starts with `get`/`list`/`create`/`fetch`/`retrieve`.

### API-RES-004 — Method semantics; updates are PUT full replaces `[both]`
**MUST** honor method contracts: `GET` is safe (no side effects), idempotent, and carries no
request body; updates use **`PUT` as a full-document replace** (the payload is the complete
new state; omitted optional members mean "unset", not "keep"); `PUT` and `DELETE` are
idempotent; `POST` is not. **MUST NOT** mutate on `GET`. `PATCH` (partial update) is not
used; introduce it only deliberately, per-resource, never alongside `PUT` for the same
resource.
**Check (spectral):** `GET`/`DELETE` declare no `requestBody`.

### API-RES-005 — Path ids are constrained `[spectral]`
**MUST** constrain path-id parameters (`type: integer` + `minimum`, or a `pattern`/`format`
for string ids) so garbage ids are rejected at the edge (→ `400`), not deep in the stack.
**Check:** every `in: path` id parameter constrains its value (`minimum`, `pattern`, `enum`,
or `format`).

### API-RES-006 — Shallow, parent-anchored nesting `[both]`
**SHOULD** nest a sub-resource under its parent **instance**
(`/teams/{id}/members/{memberId}`) and keep nesting shallow (parent instance + child).
Deeper relationships are reached through the child resource's own endpoints, not more
`/{id}` segments.
**Check (spectral):** no path carries three or more `{param}` segments.

### API-RES-007 — Delete is idempotent in effect `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** make `DELETE` (and any soft-delete flip) safe to retry: deleting a missing **or
already-deleted** resource answers `404`, a successful delete `204`; repeating the call
converges on `404` with no further state change. With soft delete, every read/list/lookup
**MUST** filter to active rows, and mutations **MUST** be guarded to active rows so a
deleted resource behaves exactly like a missing one.
**Check:** double-DELETE yields `204` then `404`; soft-deleted rows are invisible to every
read and unmodifiable by every write.

---

## API-VER — Versioning & compatibility

### API-VER-001 — Major version in the URL path `[both]`
**MUST** carry the API's **major** version as the leading path segment pair `/api/v<major>/`
(currently `/api/v1/`) on every route. **MUST NOT** version via query parameters or
media-type parameters. Minor, backward-compatible evolution happens **within** the prefix
(API-VER-002); a new prefix (`/api/v2/`) appears only with a breaking change.
**Check (spectral):** every path matches `^/api/v\d+/`. **Check (review):** in-prefix changes
are additive only.
**Why:** visible in every URL, log line, and curl; trivially routable; one version + one
first-party client makes header negotiation pure overhead.

### API-VER-002 — Evolve additively; break only with a new major `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** evolve a released version **additively**; any breaking change goes in a new major.

- **Backward-compatible:** new endpoint; new *optional* request field/param; new response
  field; new enum value on a read-only field; relaxed validation.
- **Breaking (new major):** removing/renaming a field, endpoint, or param; making an optional
  request field required; narrowing a type or tightening validation; changing meaning, units,
  or a status code; new enum value on a field the client sends back.

**Check:** a released version's diff is backward-compatible only.

### API-VER-003 — Tolerant reader `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** design consumers to **ignore unknown fields** in responses; **MUST** document one
uniform policy for unknown request fields/params (ignore vs. reject) and apply it everywhere —
for query parameters that policy is settled in API-LIST-004 (unknown names ignored, repeated
scalars rejected); unknown request-BODY members are rejected by strict deserialization.
**Check:** unknown response members are tolerated; the request-side policy is documented.

### API-VER-004 — Deprecate before removal `[both]`
**SHOULD NOT** remove/break without a deprecation window. Deprecated operations/fields
**SHOULD** be marked `deprecated: true` (with a migration note), signalled with `Deprecation`
and, when known, `Sunset` headers, and keep supporting the previous major (N-1).
**Check (spectral):** anything `deprecated: true` carries a `description` with the migration
path.

---

## API-LIST — Collections (fetching)

Every list endpoint follows all of these; the OpenAPI spec documents each endpoint's
whitelists (API-NAME-004).

### API-LIST-001 — Envelope totals are consistent `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** return the API-STRUCT-004 envelope where `total` is the row count **after filters
but before pagination**, and **MUST** compute the count and the page rows within the same
transaction (or equivalent consistent snapshot) so they never disagree.
**Check:** `total` reflects the filtered set; count + rows share a transaction.

### API-LIST-002 — Offset pagination; cursor is a per-endpoint opt-in `[both]`
**MUST** paginate with `page` (1-based, default `1`, must be ≥ 1) and `pageSize` (default
`20`, max `100`); out-of-range values → `400` + problem detail. Cursor pagination is **not**
the default: adopt it only per-endpoint when stable ordering under heavy concurrent writes is
actually needed, and document the cursor format in that endpoint's OpenAPI definition.
**Check (spectral):** `page`/`pageSize` appear only as `$ref`s to the shared parameters
(API-NAME-003). **Check (review):** defaults, bounds, and `400` behavior.

### API-LIST-003 — Sorting via `sort`, `-` for descending `[both]`
**MUST** sort through a single `sort` parameter: `field` ascending, `-field` descending,
comma-separated multi-field with leftmost winning (`sort=-lastModified,id`). Each endpoint
declares an explicit whitelist of sortable fields; an unknown field → `400`. **MUST** append
`id` ascending as a deterministic tiebreaker so paging is stable, and **MUST** document the
default sort (if the client sends none, `id` ascending unless stated otherwise).
**Check (spectral):** `sort` appears only as a `$ref` to the shared parameter. **Check
(review):** whitelist enforced; tiebreaker appended; default documented.

### API-LIST-004 — Filtering: whitelisted equality + a tiny operator surface `[both]`
**MUST** filter by whitelisted equality on the field's own name (`?status=DRAFT&providerId=42`);
an unknown value in a whitelisted field → `400`. An unknown query parameter **name** is
**ignored** — deliberate leniency (clients may carry extra params; new server params must not
break old clients); "unknown fields → 400" governs values of recognized filter fields, not
the parameter namespace (clarified 2026-08-22, MT-003). Repeating a key is **reserved** to
mean `IN` (`?status=DRAFT&status=SENT`) — implement per-endpoint when a UI needs it, and
document it; until an endpoint does, a **repeated scalar key MUST be a `400`** (never silent
first-value-wins — enforced centrally in the shared param helpers since v2.35.0).
Range/operator filters use bracket suffixes, only where an endpoint needs them:
`field[gte]`, `field[gt]`, `field[lte]`, `field[lt]` for ordered types. **MUST NOT** add
`[like]`, `[ne]`, or `[in]` (use repetition for `IN`) — keep the operator surface tiny.
Booleans are strict `true`/`false`; enums use their string name; malformed values → `400`.
**Check (spectral):** query params match the camelCase-plus-bracket-operator grammar
(API-NAME-002). **Check (review):** whitelist + strict value parsing + `400`s.

### API-LIST-005 — Free-text search via `q`; per-column substring by exception `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** expose free-text search as a single `q` param; the endpoint decides which columns
`q` searches and documents them. Per-column, case-insensitive substring matching on the
column's own name (e.g. `?name=ali`) is allowed **only** when a UI genuinely needs per-column
matching `q` cannot express — reach for `q` first, promote to per-column only when required,
and document each occurrence.
**Check:** every substring/search param is documented with its searched columns.

---

## API-NAME — Member & parameter naming

### API-NAME-001 — camelCase members, consistently `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** use **camelCase** for every JSON member name (request and response), across the
whole API. No `snake_case`, no mixed conventions.
**Check:** every schema property uses camelCase.

### API-NAME-002 — camelCase query params, bracket suffixes only for operators `[spectral]`
**MUST** name query parameters in `camelCase` (`pageSize`, not `page_size`), with the only
bracket use being the range-operator suffixes of API-LIST-004 (`lastModified[gte]`).
**MUST NOT** use JSON:API-style family params (`page[size]`, `filter[x]`, `fields[t]`).
**Check:** every query parameter `name` matches
`^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(\[(gte|gt|lte|lt)\])?$`.

### API-NAME-003 — Reusable components `[both]`
**MUST** define the shared query parameters (`Page`, `PageSize`, `Sort`, and `Q` once a `q`
endpoint exists) once under `#/components/parameters` and `$ref` them from each list path —
never re-inline them. Shared error responses and the problem schema likewise live once under
`#/components` (see API-DOC-004).
**Check (spectral):** no inline path parameter is named `page`/`pageSize`/`sort`. **Check
(review):** error/problem schemas are shared.

### API-NAME-004 — Document sortable/filterable fields `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** document, per list endpoint, its sortable fields, filterable fields, and default
sort in the parameter/endpoint descriptions in the OpenAPI document.
**Check:** the description for each list path names its allowed sort/filter fields.

---

## API-DATA — Data-format conventions

*(Review-only — value-level conventions a spec linter can't reliably enforce.)*

### API-DATA-001 — Instants are epoch millis; dates are ISO strings `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** represent instants (timestamps) as **epoch-millisecond integers** (UTC by
definition) and date-only values as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` **strings** (always zero-padded —
lexicographic order must equal chronological order). **MUST NOT** mix representations for
the same kind of value or use locale-dependent formats.
**Check:** every timestamp field is an epoch-millis number; every date-only field is a padded
ISO string.

### API-DATA-002 — Exact numerics as strings `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** carry monetary and other exact-decimal values as **strings** (never binary floats)
with an explicit currency/unit alongside, to avoid precision loss.
**Check:** money/decimals are strings with a currency/unit field.

### API-DATA-003 — Enums are named strings `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** represent enumerated values as documented, named strings (not magic numbers), and
declare the allowed set in the schema (`enum`).
**Check:** enumerated fields are string `enum`s, documented.

---

## API-OK — Success status codes

### API-OK-001 — Create → `201` + `Location` `[both]`
**MUST** answer a successful creation with `201 Created`, a `Location` header to the new
resource, and the created resource (or a creation report) in the body.
**Check (spectral):** a `201` response declares a `Location` header.

### API-OK-002 — Reads → `200` `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** answer a successful read (single or collection) with `200 OK` and a JSON body.
**Check:** `GET` success is `200` with a body.

### API-OK-003 — Updates → `200` or `204`, consistently `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** answer a successful update (`PUT`) with `200` (returning the updated resource) or
`204 No Content`, applying one convention consistently across the API (this codebase uses
`204` everywhere; the client re-fetches when it needs the new state).
**Check:** update responses follow the documented convention.

### API-OK-004 — No-body operations → `204` `[both]`
**MUST** answer a successful operation that returns no document with `204 No Content`, and
the `204` response **MUST NOT** carry a body.
**Check (spectral):** every `204` response declares no `content`.

### API-OK-005 — Deferred work → `202` `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** answer accepted-but-not-completed work with `202 Accepted` (e.g. a request whose
processing continues after the response for latency-uniformity reasons).
**Check:** async operations return `202`, not `200`/`201`.

---

## API-ERR — Errors

### API-ERR-001 — RFC 7807 problem details `[both]`
**MUST** return every error body as [RFC 7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807)
`application/problem+json` with the members `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance`
(one shared `ProblemDetail` schema). Emit them through a single central helper so
content-type and shape can never drift per-route. **MUST NOT** return bare strings, HTML, or
ad-hoc error JSON.
**Check (spectral):** every `4xx`/`5xx` declares `application/problem+json` with a
`title`+`status` schema.

### API-ERR-002 — Canonical status-code mapping `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** map failures consistently:

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Malformed / invalid request (incl. oversized payloads, invalid stored-text such as NUL bytes) | `400` |
| Missing / invalid authentication | `401` |
| Authenticated but not permitted | `403` |
| Resource does not exist (or is soft-deleted — API-RES-007) | `404` |
| Known path, unsupported method (problem body via the central status handler; no `Allow` header — Ktor does not surface the allowed-method set, accepted) | `405` |
| Unacceptable / conflicting media type | `406` / `415` |
| State-machine conflict, uniqueness violation (DB unique-constraint errors **MUST** be caught and mapped, never surface as `500`) | `409` |
| Failed precondition (`If-Match`) | `412` |
| Semantically invalid (well-formed) entity | `422` |
| Rate limit / throttle / lockout exceeded | `429` |
| Unexpected server error (logged) | `500` |
| Feature disabled in this deployment | `503` |

**Check:** declared error responses use these codes for these meanings.

### API-ERR-003 — Human-readable, actionable, leak-free `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** give each error a human-readable `title` and a `detail` specific enough for the
client to act on (which field, which constraint). **MUST NOT** leak secrets, stack traces, or
internals — and **MUST NOT** let error *behavior* leak information either (e.g. an
account-enumeration oracle from differing login errors; see API-ERR-006).
**Check:** validation errors identify the offending field; error text/timing reveals nothing
sensitive.

### API-ERR-004 — Correlation id on every response `[both]`
**MUST** echo a correlation/request id on **every** response via `X-Request-Id`, generating
one when the client didn't send it, and **SHOULD** surface it in problem bodies so logs and
reports can be tied to a call. *(Registered gap: the reference implementation reads the
header but does not yet echo/generate — see the appendix.)*
**Check (spectral, hint):** responses declare an `X-Request-Id` header. **Check (review):**
it is echoed/generated at runtime.

### API-ERR-005 — Declare & order the error responses `[both]`
**MUST** declare, on every operation: `500`; `401` if it requires auth; `400` if it takes
input. A bad input **MUST NOT** surface as a `500` (it is a `400`/`422`), and authorization
**MUST** be evaluated **before** payload validation (`403` outranks `400` — a non-privileged
caller learns nothing about payload rules). Validation depth is owned by **API-SEC-003**.
**Check (spectral):** each operation lists `500`; body-taking ops list `400`. **Check
(review):** `401` on secured ops; guard-then-validate ordering; no `500` from bad input.

### API-ERR-006 — Deliberate existence-disclosure policy `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** choose per resource between guard-before-read (uniform `403`, hides existence) and
read-before-guard (`404` vs `403` — reveals existence, never content), and apply the choice
consciously and consistently per resource. The same discipline applies to unauthenticated
flows: account existence **MUST NOT** be observable from responses, timing, or throttling
differences.
**Check:** each resource follows one idiom intentionally; enumeration probes learn nothing.

### API-ERR-007 — Conflicts point at the conflicting resource `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD**, when a `409` is caused by an existing record (duplicate, open conflict), carry
that record's URI in the problem body's `instance` member so clients can link straight to it.
*(Registered gap: populated where the service knows the row today — the feedback duplicate
`409` and the days-off overlap `409`; the generic unique-violation handler cannot.)*
**Check:** duplicate-style `409`s populate `instance` with the existing resource's URI.

---

## API-AUTH — Authentication & authorization

### API-AUTH-001 — Declare authentication `[both]`
**MUST** declare authentication via OpenAPI `securitySchemes`, and every non-public operation
**MUST** carry a `security` requirement (globally or per-operation). Public endpoints are the
documented exception.
**Check (spectral):** `components.securitySchemes` is defined and a `security` requirement
applies (root or per-operation).

### API-AUTH-002 — Standard scheme, credentials in headers `[both]`
**MUST** use a standard scheme (HTTP `bearer` / OAuth2). Credentials and tokens travel in the
`Authorization` header — **MUST NOT** appear in the URL path or query string (they leak into
logs, history, and referrers).
**Check (spectral):** no `apiKey` security scheme uses `in: query`. **Check (review):** the
scheme is bearer/OAuth2.

### API-AUTH-003 — 401 vs 403 `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** return `401` when authentication is missing/invalid and `403` when the caller is
authenticated but not permitted (ties API-ERR-002 and the disclosure policy API-ERR-006).
Short-lived access tokens with refresh exchange **SHOULD** be the session model; a refresh
token **MUST NOT** authenticate an API call.
**Check:** unauthenticated → `401`; authenticated-but-forbidden → `403`; token types are
enforced.

### API-AUTH-004 — Least-privilege guards, close to the route `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** enforce per-resource authorization with explicit guards at the top of each route
handler (default-deny), and **SHOULD** document the role/permission model per operation.
Admin bypasses are deliberate, documented exceptions — never the default.
**Check:** every handler guards before acting; the permission model is documented and minimal.

---

## API-CACHE — Caching & concurrency

### API-CACHE-001 — Validators on cacheable reads `[both]`
**SHOULD** send an `ETag` (or `Last-Modified`) on cacheable `GET` responses and honor
`If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` with `304 Not Modified`. *(Registered gap.)*
**Check (spectral, hint):** `GET` `200`s declare an `ETag` header. **Check (review):**
conditional requests yield `304`.

### API-CACHE-002 — Explicit `Cache-Control` `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** set a deliberate `Cache-Control` on every response class (e.g. `no-store` for
sensitive/authed data, `max-age` for static assets) rather than relying on defaults.
*(Registered gap: only CSS is covered today.)*
**Check:** responses carry a deliberate `Cache-Control`.

### API-CACHE-003 — Optimistic concurrency on writes `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** protect lost-update-prone writes with conditional requests: accept `If-Match`
against the resource's `ETag` and return `412 Precondition Failed` on mismatch. Domain-level
guards (e.g. "only the latest document is editable" → `409`) are an acceptable alternative
where they fit the model better — document which one each write uses. *(Registered gap: no
`If-Match`/`412` anywhere; the per-write inventory lives under the known-gaps register.)*
**Check:** concurrency-sensitive `PUT`/`DELETE` have a documented lost-update defense.

### API-CACHE-004 — Push for hot data `[llm/manual]`
**MAY** offer webhooks or server-sent events for frequently-changing data instead of forcing
clients to poll; when offered, the event catalog and delivery/retry semantics **MUST** be
documented. Polling with a modest interval (as the SPA does for notifications/alerts) is an
acceptable default at this scale.
**Check:** a documented push channel exists where polling would be wasteful.

---

## API-RATE — Rate limiting

### API-RATE-001 — Signal limits on `429` `[both]`
**MUST** answer a throttled request with `429 Too Many Requests` and a problem body;
**SHOULD** carry a `Retry-After` header and expose the budget via `RateLimit-Limit`,
`RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`. *(Registered gap: headers not yet sent.)*
Per-account lockouts **MUST** be indistinguishable for existing and non-existing accounts
(API-ERR-006).
**Check (spectral):** a declared `429` declares a `Retry-After` header. **Check (review):**
header values at runtime; lockout uniformity.

### API-RATE-002 — Document the limits `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** document the rate limits (scope, window, quota) — ideally in the machine-readable
SLA (API-META-001).
**Check:** limits are documented and discoverable.

---

## API-IDEM — Idempotency

### API-IDEM-001 — Idempotency keys on unsafe writes `[both]`
**SHOULD** accept an `Idempotency-Key` header on non-idempotent operations (`POST` that
creates; any retryable unsafe operation): replaying the **same key with the same request**
returns the original response; reusing a key with a **different** payload → `422`; the
retention window is documented. *(Registered gap: not implemented; domain-level no-duplicate
invariants — create → `409` while an open duplicate exists — currently cover the practical
double-submit cases.)*
**Check (spectral, hint):** create `POST`s declare an `Idempotency-Key` parameter. **Check
(review):** replay semantics, or a documented domain-level equivalent.

### API-IDEM-002 — Safe/idempotent methods need no key `[llm/manual]`
`GET`/`HEAD` (safe) and `PUT`/`DELETE` (idempotent by contract, API-RES-004/007) **MUST** be
naturally repeatable without a key.
**Check:** retrying `PUT`/`DELETE` converges to the same state.

---

## API-SEC — Input & transport security

*(Review-only — a spec linter cannot validate runtime/transport behavior.)*

### API-SEC-001 — HTTPS everywhere `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** serve production traffic only over TLS (**≥ 1.2, prefer 1.3**), send
`Strict-Transport-Security`, redirect HTTP→HTTPS, and manage certificates through a managed
PKI (TLS MAY terminate at a proxy/ingress — then forwarded-header handling must be explicit
and spoof-proof). Plain HTTP **MUST NOT** carry credentials or data outside local dev.
**Check:** production is HTTPS-only with HSTS; forwarded headers only honored behind a
declared proxy.

### API-SEC-002 — Injection-immune by construction `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** build all data-store access with parameterized queries / bound statements (never
string-concatenated SQL), and **MUST** neutralize/encode stored user content so downstream
consumers are not exposed to XSS. User input is untrusted everywhere — including values that
merely pass through (DB error payloads, NUL bytes → `400`, API-ERR-002).
**Check:** no dynamically-built query strings; stored content is encoded on output.

### API-SEC-003 — Comprehensive input validation, after authz `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** validate every input (type, length, range, format, allowed values) at the boundary —
feature-local validators in the route layer, run **after** the authorization guard
(API-ERR-005) — and reject violations with a clear `400`/`422` before any persistence, so
bad input never dies in the database as a `500`.
**Check:** oversized/blank/malformed inputs are rejected with a field-level message; guards
run first.

---

## API-HTTP — Protocol

### API-HTTP-001 — HTTP/2 baseline, HTTP/3 opt-in `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** support **HTTP/2** at the public edge (typically the TLS-terminating
proxy/ingress; the app server behind it may speak HTTP/1.1); **MAY** offer HTTP/3 (QUIC) via
`Alt-Svc`. *(Registered gap: no edge deployment configures this yet.)*
**Check:** the public endpoint negotiates HTTP/2.

---

## API-META — Machine-readable SLA & legal terms

### API-META-001 — Machine-readable SLA `[both]`
**SHOULD** publish the service-level commitments (availability target, rate limits, support
window) in machine-readable form as OpenAPI vendor extensions (a top-level `x-sla` object)
alongside human-readable Markdown. *(Registered gap.)*
**Check (spectral):** the document declares an `x-sla` extension.

### API-META-002 — Legal terms linked `[both]`
**SHOULD** reference the terms of service / legal terms from the spec
(`info.termsOfService`). *(Registered gap.)*
**Check (spectral):** `info.termsOfService` is set.

---

## API-DOC — OpenAPI as the contract

### API-DOC-001 — Spec is the single source of truth `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** maintain a hand-authored OpenAPI document as the authoritative contract and change
it **in the same change** as any route change — then regenerate client types from it and
commit them. No endpoint/param/status may exist in code but not the spec, or vice versa
(API-CONF-001 enforces this at test time).
**Check:** spec diff accompanies every route diff; generated types are in sync.

### API-DOC-002 — Keep it 3.0-compatible `[spectral]`
**MUST** stay OpenAPI 3.0-compatible while the toolchain requires it (`nullable: true`,
never `type: [..., "null"]`). Note the deliberate split: the committed document is
LABELED `openapi: 3.1.0` (openapi-typescript wants it) while its BODY stays 3.0-shaped —
the conformance harness relabels it 3.0.3 in memory for swagger-request-validator
(`OpenApiConformance.kt`) and `OpenApiSpecTest` pins that no 3.1-only construct creeps in.
**Check:** no schema uses a `type` array containing `"null"`.

### API-DOC-003 — Unique operationIds `[spectral]`
**MUST** give every operation a unique `operationId`.
**Check:** no `operationId` is repeated.

### API-DOC-004 — Shared error responses, inline only for specifics `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** define the generic error responses (`Unauthorized`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`,
`Conflict`, `TooManyRequests`, `InternalServerError`, …) once under `#/components/responses`
and `$ref` them; declare an error inline **only** to give it a case-specific `description`
(the body is still the shared `ProblemDetail` schema — API-ERR-001 lints that either way).
**Check:** generic errors are `$ref`s; inline declarations carry a case-specific description.

---

## API-CONF — Spec ↔ implementation conformance

Conformance is a property of the test/verification harness, not of a static document — so all
of these are `[llm/manual]`.

### API-CONF-001 — Automated conformance checking `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** verify real request/response traffic against the spec automatically, so drift fails
the build (undeclared endpoint/method/status, response-schema or content-type mismatch) —
e.g. by validating the test suite's HTTP interactions against the spec via a client-side
validator plugin installed in the shared test client.
**Check:** a response deviating from the spec fails CI.

### API-CONF-002 — Response-side validation mandatory; request-side may relax `[llm/manual]`
**MUST** fully validate responses; request-side validation **MAY** relax to unknown
path/method so deliberately-malformed negative tests survive.
**Check:** negative tests run; response conformance stays on.

### API-CONF-003 — Track conformance coverage `[llm/manual]`
**SHOULD** report exercised vs. declared (operation, status) pairs after each test run — a
report, not a gate.
**Check:** a coverage report is produced.

### API-CONF-004 — Spec-driven fuzzing `[llm/manual]`
**MAY** run property-based fuzzing from the spec (Schemathesis) periodically; a `5xx` count
above zero is the signal. Runs are manual/out-of-CI; findings are triaged to zero
unexplained `5xx`s.
**Check:** fuzz runs are reproducible and triaged.

## LLM review checklist

Feed this file plus the target OpenAPI document (or route code) to a reviewer and have it
assess the `[llm/manual]` and `[both]` rules — pass / fail / N-A, citing the rule ID. Items
on the [known-gaps register](#appendix-known-gaps-register) are reported as **"registered
gap"**, not as findings.

- **API-STRUCT-003/004** — Flat camelCase DTOs with `*Id` references; every list wrapped in
  the `{items,page,pageSize,total}` envelope with a per-resource `*Page` schema?
- **API-RES-004/007** — `PUT` is a documented full replace; `GET` never mutates; deletes
  idempotent in effect with soft-deleted rows invisible everywhere?
- **API-VER-001/002/003/004** — Everything under `/api/v1/`; in-version changes
  backward-compatible; tolerant reader; deprecations carry notice + `Deprecation`/`Sunset`?
- **API-LIST-001/002** — `total` after filters before paging, count + rows in one
  transaction; `page`/`pageSize` bounds enforced with `400`s; any cursor adoption documented
  per-endpoint?
- **API-LIST-003/004/005 / API-NAME-004** — Sort whitelist rejecting unknown fields with
  `400`; unknown values of recognized filter fields `400` (unknown parameter NAMES are
  deliberately ignored — see API-LIST-004); repeated scalar keys `400` until an endpoint
  implements documented `IN`; `id` tiebreaker; strict boolean/enum parsing; documented
  `q`/substring params?
- **API-NAME-001** — camelCase members everywhere?
- **API-DATA-001/002/003** — Epoch-millis instants + padded ISO dates; exact numerics as
  strings; enums as named, documented strings?
- **API-OK-001..005** — Correct success code per operation (`201`+`Location`, `200`,
  consistent update convention, `204` no-body, `202` deferred)?
- **API-ERR-002/003/006/007** — Right status per meaning (23505 → `409`, NUL → `400`);
  actionable leak-free errors; one intentional existence-disclosure idiom per resource;
  duplicate `409`s carrying `instance` *(registered gap for the generic handler)*?
- **API-ERR-004** — Correlation id echoed on every response? *(registered gap)*
- **API-ERR-005 / API-SEC-003** — `500`/`401`/`400` declared; authz before validation; every
  boundary input validated feature-locally?
- **API-AUTH-001..004** — Schemes declared + applied; bearer with credentials in headers
  only; `401` vs `403` + token-type enforcement; default-deny guards at the top of every
  handler?
- **API-CACHE-001..004** — ETag/304 *(registered gap)*; deliberate `Cache-Control`
  *(registered gap)*; a documented lost-update defense per concurrent write *(registered gap —
  see the register's inventory)*; push channel where polling would be wasteful?
- **API-RATE-001/002** — `429` + problem body; `Retry-After`/`RateLimit-*` *(registered
  gap)*; uniform lockout behavior; limits documented?
- **API-IDEM-001/002** — Idempotency keys or a documented domain-level equivalent
  *(registered gap)*; `PUT`/`DELETE` naturally repeatable?
- **API-SEC-001/002** — HTTPS-only + HSTS in production; spoof-proof forwarded headers;
  parameterized queries + output encoding?
- **API-HTTP-001** — HTTP/2 at the public edge? *(registered gap)*
- **API-META-001/002** — `x-sla` + `info.termsOfService`? *(registered gaps)*
- **API-DOC-001/004 / API-CONF-001..004** — Spec changed with the route change and types
  regenerated; generic errors shared; drift fails CI; response-side conformance on; coverage
  tracked; fuzzing triaged?

## Appendix: known-gaps register

Accepted, registered non-conformances of the reference implementation (Kotlin/Ktor). Each is
prescribed by a rule above, deliberately not implemented yet, and cheap to adopt when
prioritized. Reviewers cite these as "registered gap"; the Spectral ruleset carries them at
`hint`/`warn` severity so they never fail a lint. Remove an entry when the gap is closed.

| Rule | Gap | Adoption pointer |
|---|---|---|
| API-ERR-004 | `X-Request-Id` is read but not echoed or generated | `CallId` config in `plugins/Monitoring.kt`: add `replyToHeader(HttpHeaders.XRequestId)` + `generate { ... }`; declare the header on responses in the spec |
| API-ERR-007 | Generic unique-violation `409`s carry no `instance` URI | `ConflictException.instance` already rides `ProblemDetail.instance` (`plugins/ErrorHandling.kt`); populated today by the feedback-duplicate and days-off-overlap `409`s — extend other domain conflict sites where the service knows the conflicting row's id (the generic 23505 handler never can, and existence-disclosure rules apply per API-ERR-006) |
| API-RATE-001 | No `Retry-After` / `RateLimit-*` headers on `429`s | Set `Retry-After` where the wait is known (login lockout knows its window); add headers to the shared `TooManyRequests` response |
| API-CACHE-001/002 | No `ETag`/`304`; `Cache-Control` only on CSS | Install `ConditionalHeaders`; extend the `CachingHeaders` config in `plugins/Http.kt` with deliberate per-class policies (`no-store` on API responses) |
| API-CACHE-003 | No `If-Match`/`ETag`/`412` conditional writes anywhere; unguarded full-document writes are last-write-wins (see the inventory below) | Add `ETag` + `If-Match` handling to the concurrency-sensitive `PUT`s if contention ever materializes; a `version` column + `409` is the R2DBC-friendly alternative |
| API-IDEM-001 | No `Idempotency-Key` handling | Domain no-duplicate `409`s cover double-submits today; adopt the header if external/retrying clients appear |
| API-HTTP-001 | HTTP/1.1 only (Netty defaults; no edge HTTP/2) | Configure HTTP/2 at the TLS-terminating ingress when one exists |
| API-META-001/002 | No `x-sla`, no `info.termsOfService` in the spec | Add both to `documentation.yaml` when commitments/terms exist to publish |
| API-DOC-004 | Some generic error declarations are inline duplicates rather than `$ref`s | Fold pure duplicates into `#/components/responses` opportunistically; keep case-specific descriptions inline |

### Lost-update inventory (the API-CACHE-003 row's per-write record)

Per API-CACHE-003, each concurrency-sensitive write documents its defense (audited 2026-08-11):

- **Domain-guarded** — a stale write is rejected by a state rule, not a validator: 1:1 meetings
  (only the pair's *latest* meeting is editable/deletable → `409`), goals (definition edits
  DRAFT-only, progress ACTIVE-only), team KPIs (same split; data-point mutations ACTIVE-only),
  performance reviews (PUT in DRAFT/CALIBRATION only, PUBLISHED read-only → `409`; delete
  DRAFT-only), pulse `my-response` (cycle OPEN only), feedbacks (PUT edits content/visibility by
  the provider only; status moves only via transition POSTs with source-status `409`s), days-off
  requests (no PUT at all — lifecycle POSTs with source-status `409`s).
- **Accepted last-write-wins** — full-document/config writes with no version check, accepted
  because writers are few and scoped (admin- or self-only) and the documents are small: users
  PUT, teams PUT (roster + manager delta rules still apply), templates PUT, dictionaries
  whole-document PUT, alerts PUT, per-user features PUT (wholesale replace by design),
  email-notifications PUT, pulse settings PUT, days-off correction PUT (single-manager writes),
  review-period/public-holiday registries (create/delete only). Two admins editing the same template simultaneously can overwrite each
  other — a deliberate, documented trade-off at this scale.
