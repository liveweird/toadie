-- Per-user feature flags (Lettuce's V46, ported): the DISABLED set — no row = feature
-- enabled, so the empty table needs no backfill and every existing/new user starts with
-- full access. No CHECK on feature: the application enum is the whitelist, so a future
-- feature needs no migration (the V1 role-CHECK is the deliberate exception, not the rule).
-- The feature index backs the users-list feature/featureEnabled filter pair.
