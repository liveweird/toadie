 * The area gate for per-user feature flags (V12): run as the FIRST guard of a gated route,
 * before any read, so a disabled caller gets a uniform 403 even for a missing id. No Toadie
 * route is gated yet — MFA (the only flag today) is login-scoped and read off the DB record;
 * the first gateable feature area brings the first call site. The set rides the JWT, so a
 * change takes effect at the next refresh (≤15 min) or login.
